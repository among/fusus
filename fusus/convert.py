"""Convenience methods to call conversions to and from tsv and to tf.

The pipeline can read Arabic books in the form of page images,
and returns structured data in the form of a tab separated file (TSV).

The PDF text extraction of the Lakhnawi file also produces a TSV file.

Both kinds of TSV files can be converted furhter into Text-Fabric.

## Input

See `fusus.works` for how to specify the input for *fusus* operations.

## TSV output

The TSV data from both the pipeline and the text extraction is one word per line.

Fields are integer valued, except for fields with names ending in $.

The fields of the pipeline results `(P)` are roughly the same as those of the
text extraction results `(T)`:

```
(P) page stripe block$ line            left top right bottom confidence letters punc$
(T) page line   column span direction$ left top right bottom            letters punc$
```

### Divisions `(P)`

Each *page* is divided into *stripe*.
Stripes are horizontal regions from the left edge to the right edge of the page/

Each *stripe* is divided into *blocks*.
Blocks are vertical parts inside a stripe, with a stroke in between.
If there is no stroke, there is only one block in the stripe.
There are at most two blocks in a stripe.

Each *block* is divided into *lines*.

See also `fusus.layout`.

Each line is divided into *words*.

### Divisions `(T)`

Each *page* is divided into *lines*.

Each *line* is divided into *columns*
(in case of hemistic verses, see `Lakhnawi.columns`).

Each *column* is divided into *spans*.
Span transitions occur precisely there where changes in writing direction occur.

Each *span* is divided into *words*.

### Fields `(TP)`

Each word occupies exactly one line in the TSV file, with the following fields:

* `(TP)` **page** page number
* `( P)` **stripe** stripe number within the page
* `( P)` **block** (empty string or `r` or `l`)
* `( P)` **line** line number within the block
* `(T )` **line** line number within the page
* `(T )` **column** column number within the line
* `(T )` **span** span number within the column
* `(T )` **direction** (`l` or `r`) writing direction of the span
* `(TP)` **left** *x* coordinate of left boundary
* `(TP)` **top** *y* coordinate of top boundary
* `(TP)` **right** *x* coordinate of right boundary
* `(TP)` **bottom** *y* coordinate of bottom boundary
* `( P)` **confidence** measure of OCR confidence (0 .. 100) percent
* `(TP)` **letters** letters of the word (possibly the empty string)
* `(TP)` **punc** non-letters after the word

### Example `(P)`

The start of the Afifi TSV:

### Example `(T)`

## Run

You can run the pipeline on the known works inside the *ur* directory in this repo or
on books that you provide yourself.

This script supports one-liners on the command line
to execute the pipeline and various conversion processes.

See  `fusus.convert.HELP`.

Here are concrete commands for known works:

---

``` sh
python3 -m fusus.convert tsv fususa
python3 -m fusus.convert tsv fususl
```

This will run the OCR pipeline for the Afifi/Lakhnawi editions respectively,
and deliver TSV data as result;

---

``` sh
python3 -m fusus.convert tf fususa 0.5
python3 -m fusus.convert tf fususl 0.5
```

This will convert the TSV data to TF and deliver the tf files in version 0.5,
for the Afifi and Lakhnawi editions resepctively.

---

``` sh
python3 -m fusus.convert tf fususa 0.5 loadonly
python3 -m fusus.convert tf fususl 0.5 loadonly
```

This will load the TF data in version 0.5.
The first time it loads, some extra computations will be performed, and
a binary version of the tf files will be generated, which will be used for
subsequent use by Text-Fabric.

---

## Load TSV

The function `loadTsv` to load TSV data in memory.
For known works, it will also convert the data types of the appropriate fields
to integer.

    ----------

        Only rows belonging to selected pages will be extracted.

    loadOnly: boolean, optional `False`
