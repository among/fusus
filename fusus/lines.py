"""Line detection

We detect lines in page blocks based on ink distribution.

Our proxy to ink distribution are histograms, but there is no easy correspondence
between the peaks in the histograms and the lines on the page.

We will need some signal processing tools from
[SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/),
in particular
[find_peaks](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html#scipy.signal.find_peaks)
and
[medfilt](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.medfilt.html#scipy.signal.medfilt),
to filter the peaks into significant peaks.

We also need to massage the ink histograms in order to correct for short lines.

    By means of histograms we can discern where the lines are.
    We define several bands with respect to lines, such as main, inter, broad,
    high, mid, low.
    We also define a band for the space between lines.

    We mark the main bands on the `layout layer` by a starting green line
    and an ending red line and the space between them will be overlaid with gray.
