"""Wipe marks from images.

Cleaning marks from images is based on
[OpenCV's template matching](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_template_matching/py_template_matching.html#template-matching)

This is fuzzy matching, so we have to employ considerable sophistication to
get the true results and to discard the fake results.

One particular way to discard fake results is to mind the connectedness of the ink
of a candidate mark with the surrounding ink.
If there is such a connection, it is a strong indication that the candidate is not
a mark to be removed, but part of a glyph.

See ![bordering](images/isolation.png)

    When searching images for image templates,

    Typically, if a point has a high match value, surrounding points also have good
    match values. We want to cluster such points, so that we can identify a match
    with exactly one cluster.
