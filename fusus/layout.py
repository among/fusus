"""Detect the page layout.

Pages consist of a header region, a body region, and a footer region, all of which
are optional.


**header**
The header consists of a caption and/or a page number.
All headers will be discarded.

**footer**
The footer consists of footnote bodies.
All footers will be discarded.

**body**
The body region consists of zero or more *stripes*.

**stripe, block, line**
A stripe is a horizontal region of the body.
If some parts of the body have two blocks and other parts have one block,
we divide the body in stripes where each stripe has a fixed number of blocks,
and neighbouring stripes have a different number of blocks.

If the whole body has the same number of blocks, we have just one stripe.

The stripes are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... from top to bottom.

The block is the empty string if a stripe has just one block,
otherwise it is `l` for the left block and `r` for the right block.

We assume that all stripes on all pages have at most two blocks.

Blocks are divided into *lines*.
The lines are numbered with the blocks that contain them.

    A vertical bar defines a stripe on the page, i.e. a horizontal band that

    Between the vertical bars there are also stripes, they are undivided stripes.

    We assume the vertical bars split the page in two portions, and not more,

    If many vertical bars have been detected, we sort them by `y1` ascending and then
    `y2` descending and then by `x`.

    We filter the bars: if the last bar reached to `y` = height, we only consider
    bars that start lower than height.

        it is possible that they start and end in the middle of the lines beside them.

    If a stripe has no vertical bar, we shrink the box
